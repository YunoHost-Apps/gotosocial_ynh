⚠️ Starting with this new version, the GoToSocial package will install the `nowasm` version if your system is not either amd64 or arm64.  
It will also use the `nowasm` version in the case of an older amd64 microprocessor that doesn't support some instruction sets.

Please note that the `nowasm` versions are **experimental and unsupported**, so please **don't** ask for support if your system uses them.
