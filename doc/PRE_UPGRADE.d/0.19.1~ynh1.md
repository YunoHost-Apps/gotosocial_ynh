This release adds a trans flag and a rainbow pride flag in the footer of the GoToSocial HTML.

**If you are in a place where it is illegal / dangerous to show such flags**, you can remove them by adding the following short custom CSS snippet to your instance-wide CSS at the bottom of the instance section of the settings panel (as admin):

```css
footer nav ul #version span {
  display: none;
}
```
