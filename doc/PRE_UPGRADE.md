GoToSocial takes some time (from some seconds to some hours) after each version upgrades to perform various things, like database migration or optimizations. 
This takes place silently without any progress information after the yunohost upgrade process.
If your instance is not accessible, please be patient and **do not** restart it or the complete server manually at the risk of breaking everything!
