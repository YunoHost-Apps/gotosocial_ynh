## Disclaimers / important information

GoToSocial is still in alpha and **may be unstable**. You can read [the roadmap](https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) to check the progress of GoToSocial's features.

GoToSocial require a **dedicated root domain**, for example: gotosocial.domain.tld.

This package is not-working SSO (single-sign on) or LDAP integration.  
You will have a separate account from the rest of your Yunohost server, potentially with a different username and password.

GoToSocial **does not provide a user interface**.  
You will need to use a Mastodon-compatible client such as [Tusky](https://tusky.app/) on Android or an instance of [Pinafore](https://pinafore.social/) on the Web.

### Things to know

#### Administration

You can login with your admin user (the one automatically created at the instalaltion) to your-instance.com/**admin** or using the public instance [gts.superseriousbusiness.org/admin](https://gts.superseriousbusiness.org/admin/) to administrate your GoToSocial instance.  
[The source code of this administration panel](https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial-admin) is available on github.

In this administration interface, you can configure the following things:

* The name of your instance
* Its description
* Your contact e-mail address
* The referring user
* Blocked domains (not to federate with)

#### Configuration

You can configure your instance using the config panel integrated in Yunohost, you will find it in the admin interface of your Yunohost by following these steps:  
`Applications > gotosocial > Configure this app (Config Panel)`

To use the GoToSocial command line, you first need to place yourself in the folder of your instance:  
`cd /var/www/gotosocial/` or `cd /var/www/gotosocial__x/` (where `x` is the installation number of your instance, in the case of multi-installation)
